# Flatpak packaging for Goodvibes

Add the Flathub repository and install the necessary SDK:

    $ make setup

To build the package, run:

    $ make

This builds both the Flatpak repo (in `repo`) and the bundle as
`<app-id>.flatpak`. To install the bundle:

    $ make install

Then run the application with `make run`, or debug with `make debug`.

An example of debug session:

    $ make debug
    [ðŸ“¦] $ alias ls='ls --color'
    [ðŸ“¦] $ alias ll='ls -l'
    [ðŸ“¦] $ cat /etc/os-release
    [ðŸ“¦] $ ...

When done, don't forget to cleanup:

    $ make uninstall
